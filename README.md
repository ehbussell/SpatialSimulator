# Individual Based Simulator Project

## Project Description

Project creating individual based simulator for running epidemics. Can handle individual-based and raster-based simulations.

## Basic Usage
For help on command line arguments, run `python .\simulator.py -h`.

Running the simulator always requires three main files:
1. Configuration file (e.g. config.ini)
1. Host position file (e.g. hosts.txt)
1. Host initial conditions file (e.g. hosts_init.txt)

The configuration file is a .ini key = value file giving many options for the simulations.  An example file with the minimal number of default parameters can be generated by running `python .\simulator.py -d`, or alternatively, with the `-k` flag the keyfile detailing all possible options is generated.

The first line of the two host files gives the number of hosts.  There is then one line per host with space delimited x,y positions or initial state string, as appropriate.

For a simple example see the example/ folder.
